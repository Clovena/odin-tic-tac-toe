### Pseudocode
#
#
# Initialize game. Consider asking for size? Or just declare as @@CONSTANT
# Store characters in a 3x3 matrix.
# Ask for input from each player - use toggle to determine which player is up.
# Chomp until single character remains, then overwrite player icon in that space.
# Probably need check that input is only 1 thru 9.
#
# Need checks on rows (all equal in nested arrays), columns (all equal in same index in outer array),
# 1-9 diagonal: equal values at row index = column index,
# 7-3 diagonal: equal values at (â€“row index % 4) = column index
